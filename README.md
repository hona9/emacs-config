# emacs-config
Emacs configuration using org-mode based on Arjen
Wiersma's <https://gitlab.com/buildfunthings/emacs-config> and Sacha Chua's <http://pages.sachachua.com/.emacs.d/Sacha.html>.

Beware: still debugging (my version, not theirs).

  * rename your existing ~/.emacs.d
  * do a git clone as follows:
  
  git clone https://github.com/maridonkers/emacs-config.git ~/.emacs.d
